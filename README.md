### 👋 Hi there

👨‍🎓 IT Student at University of Agder

🤓 Experience with HTML, CSS, SQL and Java. Currently learning Javascript through various small projects, such as my [online resume](https://johannesleite.onrender.com/) and this (very) [simple Formula 1 Express project](https://github.com/Leitemods/f1race)
